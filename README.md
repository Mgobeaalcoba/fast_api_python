# FastAPI Python Web Application

This repository contains a FastAPI web application built using Python. The application is designed to showcase the features and functionality of FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Features

- FastAPI's automatic request and response validation
- Asynchronous support for efficient handling of concurrent requests
- Easy-to-use and intuitive API route definition
- Built-in support for Swagger UI and interactive API documentation
- Dependency injection for handling complex application dependencies
- Integration with popular databases and ORMs
- Exception handling and error responses
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Testable code with built-in test client

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- (Additional requirements depending on the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mgobeaalcoba/fast_api_python.git
```
2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd fast_api_python
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

   - For macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Run the application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

7. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the FastAPI application.

## Project Structure

- `app`: This directory contains the main FastAPI application code.
  - `api`: API-related modules and routes.
  - `models`: Data models and schemas.
  - `services`: Business logic and services.
  - `utils`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `tests`: Test modules and files for testing the application.
- `main.py`: Entrypoint to start the FastAPI application.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
